    "To explain the technique of saturation, we'll use the example problem of deciding if a given propositional logic formula in CNF is **un**satisfiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical approach is to express satisfiability, in the sense that we construct an program *P* whose answer sets correspond to satisfying assignments, and thus there is at least one answer set if and only if the formula is satisfiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now use saturation to construct a program *P* that has an answer set if and only if the propositional logic formula is **unsatisfiable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What's the point?\" you may ask. Indeed, for the simple example of satisfiability we wouldn't need this complicated solution. But there are some more complicated problems that we can only express using this more complicated method (in combination with the typical modelling of NP-type problems).\n",

    "## Saturation in a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "The main ideas behind the technique of saturation are the following.\n",
    "- We use rules with disjunction in the head to generate a search space that includes all candidate solutions.\n",
    "- We introduce some rules that check, for everything in this search space, whether it is *invalid* or *incorrect*.\n",
    "  - Invalid means that it does not correspond to a candidate solution.\n",
    "  - Incorrect means that it does correspond to a candidate solution, but not an actual solution.\n",
    "- We add some rules that enforce that for every invalid or incorrect option, all atoms involved in this entire process are true.\n",
    "  - This is what the word 'saturation' refers to: making all involved atoms/facts true.\n",
    "- Finally, we add a constraint that states that any answer set must be saturated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the effect that there can only be an answer set if there is **no solution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is no solution (in other words, the search space contains only invalid and incorrect options), then the rules in the program enforce saturation. We must select at least one option in the search space, and whichever one we pick will lead to saturation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is some solution (in other words, the search space contains some valid and correct option), then there cannot be an answer set. Why is this? This is because the definition of answer sets says that an answer set must be a *minimal* model of its own reduct. Because of the last constraint, the only candidate for an answer set is the saturated set (i.e., the set with all atoms true). But this is not a minimal model, because there is a smaller model (namely, the one that corresponds to some valid and correct option in the search space).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Back to our example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run through the steps involved in saturation for our example of unsatisfiability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to use some rules with disjunction in the head to generate a search space. Our candidate solutions are the truth assignments to the variables in $\\varphi$, so we'll generate a search space that includes this."
